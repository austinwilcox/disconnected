            Fix Deno.run to Deno.Command as Deno.run is being deprecated. I have resolved the issue where you supply the global basePath as ~/ and the window basePath as ~/ by adding a new key in the json structure called concatenateBasePathToGlobalBasePath. This will prevent issues such as cd ~/~/ being run in the window. 

            Window basePaths can now use relative paths.

            When you attach to the session the -c command is attached which will instantiate all new windows to the global basePath directory you specify in the config file.
